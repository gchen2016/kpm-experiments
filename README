How to run an experiment
========================

1) Run the experiments
----------------------

The following command 

$ ./run.sh INSTANCESET NCPU

executes an experiment on instanceset INSTANCESET using NCPU cpus.

To run all experiments using one CPU core, run the following commands:

$ ./run.sh empty-unbounded-r150-sgoverlap 1
$ ./run.sh empty-unbounded-r75 1
$ ./run.sh four-boxes-r75 1

2) Process the data
-------------------

The experiment results will stored be in the instances/INSTANCESET/data.out.head. 
The results are processed using an R-script in makeplots.r. 
Edit the name of the instance set at the beginning of the script and run the script. 
The resulting plots will be in instances/plots folder. 

3) Inspect the source code
--------------------------

The folder "solvers" contains glue code that integrates the following java libraries:

1) deconflictiontools (contains, kPM, PP, and OD)
     hg clone http://jones.felk.cvut.cz/repo/alite-deconflictiontools
