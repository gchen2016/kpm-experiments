Multi-robot Planning Solvers
==================================

Compiling
---------
The dependencies are managed using Maven. To compile the project and create a jar archive with dependencies run:	

$ mvn package

The jar archive with all dependencies will be in:

target/kpm-experiments-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Alternatively, you can open the project in your favorite IDE, i.e. in Eclipse.

Getting started
---------------

The planners are run through cz.agents.admap.creator.ScenarioCreator class. 

Parameters:
  -problemfile 		Path to an xml file with problem description.
  -method			Specifies method to be used to solve the problem. One of {PP, ORCA, KDPMD, ODCN}. KDPMD is the penalty method, ODCN is the OD algorith.
  -k                Number of iterations performed by penalty method.
  -maxtime			Specifies the maximum time considered during trajectory planning.
  -timestep			The discretization of time-dimension used during trajectory planning.
  -showvis          Turns on/off the visualization.
  
Detailed information can be derived from the source code, in particular from the method tt.jointeuclid2ni.Solver.parseArguments().  

Example: 
--------

The following command will run the penlaty method on the example problem instance described in file scenarios/headson.xml.

	$ java -jar solvers/target/kpm-experiments-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -method KDPMD -k 20 -problemfile scenarios/headson.xml -maxtime 21000 -timestep 21 -showvis -summary

Visualization control: 
----------------------

When the visualization window pops-up, use the following keys to toggle various useful visualization layers:
  m - missions/tasks of agents
  t - trajectories of agents
  g - planning graph
  p - polygons representing obstacles 
  
The movement of agents can be simulated by pressing (and holding) the following keys:
  q - move time forwards
  a - move time backwards
  <space> - reset time to 0
  
Dragging with right mouse button pressed moves the viewport. Mouse wheel zooms the view.
